build layer by layer

breadth first search saving layers
build from bottom up

PROBLEM:  Derivation list is in depth first order
SOLUTION: Store jar from layer-id to nodes
          Expand rules depth first, keeping track of depth and adding to jar

1) initialize queue with start (%expr) and add it to the list of layers

2)
in a loop
pop current layer: - adding productions of non-terminals to the queue
                   - adding either the non-terminal and it's rule or the terminal to the new layer
add new layer to list of layers
end loop

3) initialize next-layer with leaves made from the bottom layer

4)
in a loop over the rest of the layers
replace next-layer with nodes for the current layer; terminals are leaves, non-terminals take their kids from next-layer

5) return the one node in the list
